# Design and implementation of a smart contract based solution.
Bachelorprojekt 2018

Prototypical implementation of a smart contract-based solution for autonomous transactions of parking costs at car parks using Ethereum.

#### Abstract

Following the introduction and implementation of blockchain technology by Bitcoin, the
concept smart contract has gained notable attention. Smart contracts considered a chunk
of executable code on a distributed network of mutually distrusting nodes are being
used on varying scenarios to transfer data among participating nodes. This paper describes
a prototypical implementation of a smart contract-based solution for autonomous
transactions of parking costs at car parks. For this purpose, we use the Ethereum
blockchain as the foundation to deploy smart contracts that run as the back end and use
a website as front end. Car owners can use the website to pay for their parking costs that
are managed by the smart contract. Through this prototypical implementation, we discuss
the applicability and suitability of smart contract-based solution in the given context.
It could be identified that there exists a discrepancy between promises and tangible
benefits that this new technology offers. At first sight, the promises may appear worldchanging,
but any appreciation about the promises at the time being seems too early to
be generally accepted.
